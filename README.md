# Blockchain in GoLang

Disclaimer: This code was created following a course on how to develop a blockchain app in GoLang.

My goal here was to learn blockchain basics and as a plus write some code in go which I never did before.

With this code you can test doing transactions between wallets, and mine blocks within a blockchain.
